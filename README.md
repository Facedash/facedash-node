This is a simple example on how you could turn information from your facebook account into interesting and dynamic metric.

## How to use facedash

Clone the repository, run `npm install` to grab the dependencies, and start hacking!

### Running the app

Runs like a typical express app:

    node app.js

### Running tests

Coming soon!

### Receiving updates from upstream

Just fetch the changes and merge them into your project with git.

## Directory Layout
This is still a basic node/expres app. Expect a basic out of the box express app folder structure.
The visual board and login are still express templates.
A backbone client is on progress
